# Hyperskidded Remote Admin
Literally an admin for your Roblox games. Uses a known method called "long polling" to handle requests.
Also a ~~closed-source project~~ (outdated, this is not closed source), so I expect nobody to fork this.

## However, if you do manage to find this...
..then you can just edit it, I dont know!

## But this has a whitelist, should I get rid of it or what?
Really, if you decide to skid this remote admin, then it needs a whitelist to level down the potential of it getting abused.
